# BilKo's PC Reborn — Pokemon Save Editor

<p align="center">
  <strong>A web-based Pokemon save editor interface supporting Gen 1–2 with a modular, themable architecture. Reborn with cleaner code, proper types, and extensible design.</strong>
</p>

---

## Overview

BilKo's PC Reborn is a browser-native Pokemon save file editor built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It allows players to load, inspect, modify, and export Pokemon save files directly in the browser — no desktop installation, backend server, or API keys required. The application currently supports **Generation I** (Red / Blue / Yellow) and **Generation II** (Gold / Silver / Crystal) save formats, with an extensible architecture designed to accommodate Generations III through IX in the future.

The editor provides a rich, game-themed UI that dynamically adapts its color palette to the loaded save's game version. It features multi-tab editing, drag-and-drop file loading, a visual PC box storage viewer, party management, Pokemon stat visualization with radar charts, and a full suite of editing tools — all running entirely client-side.

---

## Key Features

### Save File Management
- **Drag-and-drop loading** — Drop `.sav` files directly onto the app to parse and open them
- **Multi-tab interface** — Work with multiple save files simultaneously, each in its own tab
- **Auto-detection** — The adapter registry automatically detects the game version from the save's binary header and checksum
- **Dirty-state tracking** — Tabs visually indicate unsaved changes; close confirmation prevents data loss
- **Export** — Download modified saves as binary `.sav` files with recalculated checksums

### Pokemon Editing
- **Full stat editing** — Modify IVs, EVs, level, experience, and all six stats with automatic recalculation
- **Move editor** — Set any of the 4 move slots with autocomplete, PP, and PP Up tracking
- **Species changer** — Reassign Pokemon species with dynamic base stat lookups
- **Visual stat graphs** — Toggle between horizontal bar charts and radar/polygon visualizations (pentagonal for Gen 1, hexagonal for Gen 2+)
- **Generation-aware panels** — The UI automatically shows or hides fields based on generation (e.g., unified Special stat for Gen 1, split SpAtk/SpDef for Gen 2+)

### Party & PC Storage
- **Party list** — View and rearrange your party of up to 6 Pokemon
- **PC box storage** — Visual grid of all 12 (Gen 1) or 14 (Gen 2) PC boxes with per-slot Pokemon previews
- **Drag-and-drop Pokemon manipulation** — Move Pokemon between party and boxes, or between boxes, using an intuitive move mode
- **Batch operations** — Transfer, swap, or move multiple Pokemon at once
- **Sorting** — Sort PC boxes by species, level, IV total, or other criteria with configurable direction

### Trainer & World Editing
- **Trainer card** — Edit player name, rival name, trainer ID, money, and badges
- **Inventory editor** — View and modify the item bag with quantity controls
- **Pokedex tracker** — Toggle seen/caught flags for each species
- **Event flags manager** — Inspect and toggle story event flags
- **Hall of Fame viewer** — Browse Hall of Fame entries
- **Battle guide** — Type effectiveness matrix with full damage multiplier display per generation

### Theming & UX
- **Dynamic game themes** — The entire UI palette shifts to match the loaded game version (Red = crimson, Blue = sapphire, Yellow = gold, etc.)
- **Dark / Light mode** — Full dark and light theme support with smooth transitions
- **Responsive layout** — Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Toast notifications** — Non-intrusive feedback for actions like copy, paste, and move operations

## Architecture

BilKo's PC Reborn is built on three architectural pillars that follow the **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: adding support for future generations requires only adding new files and registering them — zero modifications to the core editor, state engines, or dashboard orchestration.

### 1. Generation Adapter Pattern (Interface Segregated)

Each Pokemon generation is encapsulated in a concrete adapter implementing the `IGenerationAdapter` interface. The adapter hides all binary offsets, stat formulas, checksum algorithms, and character encoding differences behind a unified API. The interface is split into focused sub-interfaces following the **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:

```
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │      React Client UI       │
                    │   (Tabs / Modals / Panels) │
                    └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                                  │ Operates on CDM
                                  ▼
                   ┌──────────────────────────────┐
                   │    Adapter Registry / Mgr    │
                   └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                                  │ Decides Active Generation
                                  ▼
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │    IGenerationAdapter      │
                    │  (Composite of 5 sub-IFs)  │
                    └────────┬────────────┬──────┘
                             │            │
            ┌────────────────┴┐          ┌┴────────────────┐
            │   Gen1Adapter   │          │   Gen2Adapter   │
            │  (Gen I engine) │          │ (Gen II engine) │
            └─────────────────┘          └─────────────────┘
```

The `IGenerationAdapter` composite interface is composed of five focused sub-interfaces:

| Sub-Interface | Methods | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `IGenerationMetadata` | `generation`, `generationName`, `supportedVersions`, `partySize`, `boxSlotCount`, `boxCount`, `typeList`, `typeChart` | Static generation configuration |
| `IGenerationBinaryOps` | `detectSave()`, `parseSave()`, `writeSave()`, `validateSave()`, `parseStandalonePokemon()`, `createStandalonePokemon()` | Binary serialization/deserialization |
| `IGenerationStatsOps` | `calculateStat()`, `recalculateStats()`, `getBaseStats()` | Stat calculation and recalculation |
| `IGenerationDataAccess` | `getPokemonName()`, `getMoveName()`, `getItemName()`, `getTypes()` | Species/move/item/type data lookups |
| `IGenerationTextCodec` | `decodeText()`, `encodeText()` | Character encoding/decoding |

Consumers should depend on the most specific sub-interface they need rather than the full composite.

### 2. Canonical Data Model (CDM)

A single, runtime-safe representation of saves (`ParsedSave`) and Pokemon (`PokemonStats`) with **generation-specific extension objects** (`genExtension`) for fields that only exist in certain eras. All core types are strongly typed with no `any` usage.

- **`PokemonStats`** — Universal fields: National Dex ID, nickname, OT name/ID, moves, level, IVs, EVs, stats, status, current HP
- **`ParsedSave`** — Universal fields: trainer metadata, party, PC boxes, Pokedex counts, event flags, raw buffer
- **`Gen1Extension`** — `catchRate`, unified `special` stat, `pikachuFriendship` (Yellow)
- **`Gen2Extension`** — Held item, DV-based shininess/gender, Pokerus, split SpAtk/SpDef, friendship, breeding data, egg cycles

### 3. Modular & Extensible UI (Component Panels + Custom Hooks)

The monolithic editor views have been decomposed into small, reusable **Component Panels** that automatically render generation-specific sections by querying the active Pokemon's `genExtension`. The **Extension Registry** allows generation adapters to dynamically inject custom UI fields into core panels at runtime.

**App.tsx** has been refactored from a 741-line god component into a clean orchestrator that delegates to custom hooks and extracted components:

| Extraction | Type | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `useToast()` | Custom Hook | Toast notification state management |
| `useMoveMode()` | Custom Hook | Global move mode state, selection, drag-and-drop, transfer logic |
| `CloseConfirmationModal` | Component | Save & close / discard changes dialog |
| `ErrorModal` | Component | Error display dialog |
| `CloseAllModal` | Component | Close all tabs confirmation dialog |
| `SaveTabBar` | Component | Multi-tab save file tab bar with version colors |
| `Toast` | Component | Toast notification display |
| `MoveModeFAB` | Component | Floating action button for move mode exit |

## How It Works

1. **Load** — Drop a `.sav` file onto the app, or use the file picker. The `AdapterRegistry` inspects the binary buffer (file size, header bytes, checksum validity) to auto-detect the game version.

2. **Parse** — The detected adapter's `parseSave()` method deserializes the raw bytes into a structured `ParsedSave` object, with generation-specific extension data available through `genExtension`.

3. **Edit** — All UI panels operate on the typed data model. Changes to Pokemon stats, moves, trainer info, inventory, etc., are applied in-memory and tracked as "dirty" state.

4. **Export** — The adapter's `writeSave()` method serializes the modified data back into the generation's binary format, recalculates all checksums, and produces a downloadable `.sav` file that is compatible with emulators and flash carts.

## Refactoring History

### Phase A — Critical Bug Fixes (2026-05-24)

The following critical bugs were identified during a comprehensive code review and have been fixed:

| Bug | Severity | Fix |
|-----|----------|-----|
| **Gen2 typeChart incomplete** — Only 3 of 17 rows defined, causing runtime crashes on type lookups | Critical | Completed all 17x17 rows of the Gen 2 type effectiveness matrix with correct values |
| **Gen2 `recalculateStats()` doesn't derive HP IV** — Used stale `mon.iv.hp` instead of computing it from Atk/Def/Spd/Spc DVs | Critical | Delegated to `recalculateGen2Stats()` which correctly derives HP IV using the Gen 2 formula |
| **`prepareForLocation()` hardcodes Generation 1** — `recalculateStats(newMon, base, 1)` and direct `GEN1_BASE_STATS` import produced wrong stats for Gen 2 saves | Critical | Replaced with adapter registry lookup using `data.generation` to select the correct adapter and stat formulas |
| **Gen2 `detectSave()` accepts corrupted files** — Returned `detected: true` even when both checksums failed if the filename contained game version hints | Critical | Now requires at least one valid checksum; returns `detected: false` when both checksums fail |
| **No bounds checking in binary parsers** — `parsePokemonStruct()` and `parseGen2PokemonStruct()` directly indexed into `Uint8Array` with computed offsets, causing crashes on corrupted/truncated saves | Critical | Added bounds validation at the start of both parsing functions; returns a safe empty Pokemon object if buffer is too small |
| **`PIKACHU_SURF_RECORD` missing from local OFFSETS** — The parser referenced `offsets.PIKACHU_SURF_RECORD` which was undefined in the local `OFFSETS_INT`/`OFFSETS_JPN` objects, causing Yellow save surf scores to always be 0 | High | Added `PIKACHU_SURF_RECORD: 0x2741` to both `OFFSETS_INT` and `OFFSETS_JPN` |
| **`AdapterRegistry.detectAndParse()` stops on first parse failure** — If one adapter detected a save but parsing threw, no other adapters were tried | Medium | Changed to continue the cascade to the next adapter on parse failure, collecting the last error for the final error message |

### Phase B — Architecture Refactoring (2026-05-24)

The following architectural improvements were implemented to make the codebase more maintainable and extensible:

#### Task 1: Break Down God Component App.tsx

**Before**: App.tsx was a 741-line god component with 14+ `useState` hooks, inline modal components, move mode logic, sort orchestration, and toast management all in one file.

**After**: App.tsx is ~200 lines of clean orchestration code that delegates to extracted custom hooks and components:

| Extraction | File | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `useToast()` | `lib/hooks/useToast.ts` | Toast notification state management |
| `useMoveMode()` | `lib/hooks/useMoveMode.ts` | Global move mode, selection, drag-and-drop, batch transfer logic (~200 lines extracted) |
| `CloseConfirmationModal` | `components/editor/modals/CloseConfirmationModal.tsx` | Save & close / discard changes dialog |
| `ErrorModal` | `components/editor/modals/ErrorModal.tsx` | Error display dialog |
| `CloseAllModal` | `components/editor/modals/CloseAllModal.tsx` | Close all tabs confirmation |
| `SaveTabBar` | `components/editor/SaveTabBar.tsx` | Multi-tab save file tab bar |
| `Toast` | `components/ui/Toast.tsx` | Toast notification display |
| `MoveModeFAB` | `components/ui/MoveModeFAB.tsx` | Move mode floating action button |

#### Task 2: Split IGenerationAdapter Using Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Before**: `IGenerationAdapter` was a monolithic 18-method interface that forced all consumers to depend on every method, even if they only needed stat calculation or data lookup.

**After**: The interface is decomposed into 5 focused sub-interfaces, with `IGenerationAdapter` as a backward-compatible composite:

| Sub-Interface | Methods | Consumers |
|---|---|---|
| `IGenerationMetadata` | 8 properties | UI components, tab bar |
| `IGenerationBinaryOps` | 6 methods | AdapterRegistry, file I/O |
| `IGenerationStatsOps` | 3 methods | Editor panels, manipulation.ts |
| `IGenerationDataAccess` | 4 methods | Panel components, autocomplete |
| `IGenerationTextCodec` | 2 methods | Text rendering, OT name editing |

A new `BaseStats` unified interface replaces the previous `any` return type from `getBaseStats()`, providing consistent field naming across Gen 1 and Gen 2 adapters. Each adapter maps its internal naming convention (Gen 1: `atk/def/spe/spc`, Gen 2: `atk/def/spe/spa/spd`) to the unified `BaseStats` (`attack/defense/speed/spAtk/spDef`).

#### Task 3: Remove `any` Types and Unsafe Casts

**Before**: 6 `any` types in core interfaces and 10+ `any` types across the codebase, including `// @ts-ignore` directives and unsafe `as any` casts.

**After**: All `any` types have been eliminated from the codebase:

| Location | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `IGenerationAdapter.recalculateStats(baseStats: any)` | `any` | `BaseStats` |
| `IGenerationAdapter.getBaseStats(dexId: number): any` | `any` | `BaseStats \| undefined` |
| `IExtensionRenderContext.onChange(field, value: any)` | `any` | `unknown` |
| `IExtensionRenderContext.theme: any` | `any` | `GameCartridge \| undefined` |
| `IExtensionRenderContext.appState?: any` | `any` | `Record<string, unknown>` |
| `ISectionExtension.render(data: any, context)` | `any` | `PokemonStats \| Record<string, unknown>` |
| `PokemonStats.genExtension?: any` | `any` | `Record<string, unknown> \| null` |
| Panel `updateField(field, value: any)` | `any` | `unknown` |
| `manipulation.ts` `// @ts-ignore` + `null` assignment | `@ts-ignore` | Proper `(PokemonStats \| null)[]` cast |
| `lib/parser/index.ts` `catch(err: any)` | `any` | `unknown` |
| `isJapaneseSave(save: any)` | `any` | `{ rawData?: Uint8Array; generation?: number }` |
| `writeBox(writer, box, offsets: any, ...)` | `any` | `Record<string, number>` |
| `validateGen1Checksum(view, offsets?: any)` | `any` | `Record<string, number>` |
| `textSpeed: any` / `gscTextSpeed: any` | `any` | `string` |
| Pokedex/sortManager `let valA: any` | `any` | `string \| number` |
| Panel `theme: null` | `null` | `undefined` (matches `GameCartridge \| undefined`) |

#### Additional Changes

- **Project renamed** from "BilKo's PC" to **"BilKo's PC Reborn"** across `package.json`, `index.html`, and `vite.config.ts`
- **AI API references removed** — `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `.env.local` references have been removed from `vite.config.ts` and documentation. No AI code existed in the codebase; only the Vite config exposed unused environment variables.
- **`vite.config.ts` simplified** — Removed `loadEnv` and `define` blocks for API keys. Updated `base` path to `/BilKos-PC-Reborn/`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! The architecture is designed to make adding new generations straightforward:

1. **Create a generation adapter** — Implement `IGenerationAdapter` (or its sub-interfaces as needed) in `/lib/generations/genN/`
2. **Define extension types** — Add `GenNExtension` to the canonical model in `/lib/canonicalModel.ts`
3. **Register UI extensions** — Use the `ExtensionRegistry` to inject generation-specific fields into existing panels
4. **Add game entries** — Define `GameCartridge` objects in `/data/games.ts` with theme colors
5. **Register the adapter** — Add the new adapter to the `AdapterRegistry` in `/lib/core/AdapterRegistry.ts`

No modifications to the core dashboard, state management, or panel components are required — the Open-Closed Principle is enforced throughout.
